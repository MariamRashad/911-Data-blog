## Why was 911 Chosen to be the Emergency Number for the U.S.?
Before turning the dial, a lot of people across the country had to wait for operator help when calling. Creating an emergency phone number is a good way to connect emergency personnel. The caller of the emergency contact depends on the operator before the emergency number is confirmed. The caller must wait for assistance and tell the operator how many people want to connect. In an emergency, the caller can simply reply to the emergency inservice name to get help.<br>
